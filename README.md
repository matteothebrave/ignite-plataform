## <p> IGNITE PLATAFORM

 -> This is an APP created with master teacher Diego Fernandes of Rocket Seat; <br> 
 -> An APP simulating classes we're having the concept is to be like an "inception" movie; <br>
-> Using HTML, TAILWIND (CSS), JS, REACT (VITE), NODEJS (SERVER), APOLLO (API FETCHER), VIME (Player on Aplication) if i forgot something, i'll edit and commit again; <br>
-> I have a great feeling of gratitude for all those free contents which is available for everyone who wants to learn. <br>
<strong> <p> (Thanks to all Rocket Seat team)
